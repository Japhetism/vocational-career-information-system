<br><p><label>This is an interactive version of the RIASEC Markers Scales</label></p>
<p><label><strong>Introduction:</strong> The Holland Occupational Themes is a theory of personality that focuses on career and vocational choice. It groups people on the basis of their suitability for six different categories of occupations. The six types yield the RIASEC acronym, by which the theory is also commonly known. The theory was developed by John L. Holland over the course of his career, starting in the 1950s. The typology has come to dominate the field of career counseling and has been incorporated into most of the popular assessments used in the field. The RIASEC Marker Scales from the Interest Item Pool were developed by Liao, Armstrong and Rounds (2008) for use in psychological research as public domain alternative to the usual assessments which are marketed commercially.</label></p>
